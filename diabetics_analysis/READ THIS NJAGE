njage san do the following:
1. make the login form and a signup form I guess using sha5 encoding
2. find a way to connect all the tables using the KSNUM or phone number(kisumu specialist number).
3. the doctor should be able to input a patients details into every field.
4. the css and javascript can be removed and you can add yours if you need
5. there is a part i've not added (Screen for diabetic complications annually or as indicated)
i'll add it after you're done.
6. The doctor said if the system is functional she can propose it to other doctors so that they can also get their s for their own clinics(each doctor does their own clinic their own way).
 
 I was having problems with the database because I used a unique key for the ksnum. you can alter it if possible kindly. check if the functions work properly to.
Call if clarification is needed.
